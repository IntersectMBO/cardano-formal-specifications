	abstract = { Abstract In this article we examine the functional central limit theorem for the first passage time of reward processes defined over a finite state space semi-Markov process. In order to apply this process for a wider range of real-world applications, the reward functions, considered in this work, are assumed to have general forms instead of the constant rates reported in the other studies. We benefit from the martingale theory and Poisson equations to prove and establish the convergence of the first passage time of reward processes to a zero mean Brownian motion. Necessary conditions to derive the results presented in this article are the existence of variances for sojourn times in each state and second order integrability of reward functions with respect to the distribution of sojourn times. We finally verify the presented methodology through a numerical illustration. },

@techreport{zheng-spencer,
	abstract = {In a network, the shortest paths between nodes are of great importance as they allow the fastest and strongest interaction between nodes. However measuring the shortest paths between all nodes in a large network is computationally expensive. In this paper we propose a method to estimate the shortest path length (SPL) distribution of a network by random walk sampling. To deal with the unequal inclusion probabilities of dyads (pairs of nodes) in the sample, we generalize the usage of Hansen-Hurwitz estimator and Horvitz-Thompson estimator (and their ratio forms) and apply them to the sampled dyads. Based on theory of Markov chains we prove that the selection probability of a dyad is proportional to the product of the degrees of the two nodes. To approximate the actual SPL for a dyad, we use the observed SPL in the induced subgraph for networks with large degree variability, i.e., the standard deviation is at least two times of the mean, and for networks with small degree variability, estimate the SPL using landmarks for networks with small degree variability. By simulation studies and applications to real networks, we find that 1) for large networks, high estimation accuracy can be achieved by using a single random or multiple random walks with total number of steps equal to at least 20 as the network size increases but tends to stabilize when the network is large enough; 3) a single random walk performs as well as multiple random walks; 4) the Horvitz-Thompson ratio estimator performs best among the four estimators.},

	abstract = {In this paper we investigate formally the relationship
                 between the notion of abstract datatypes in an
                 arbitrary institution, found in algebraic specification
                 languages like \textsc{Clear}, ASL and \textsc{Casl};
                 and the notion of schemata from the model-oriented
                 specification language Z. To this end the institution S
                 of the logic underlying Z is defined and a translation
                 of Z-schemata to abstract datatypes over S is given.
                 The notion of a schema is internal to the logic of Z
                 and thus specification techniques of Z relying on the
                 notion of a schema can only be applied in the context
                 of Z. By translating Z-schemata to abstract datatypes
                 these specification techniques can be transformed to
                 specification techniques using abstract datatypes.
                 Since the notion of abstract datatypes is institution
                 independent, this results in a separation of these
                 specification techniques from the specification
                 language Z and allows them to be applied in the context
                 of other, e.g. algebraic, specification languages.},

	abstract = {The Common Algebraic Specification Language
                 (\textsc{Casl}) is an expressive language for the
                 formal specification of functional requirements and
                 modular design of software. It has been designed by
                 CoFI, the international Common Framework Initiative for
                 algebraic specification and development. It is based on
                 a critical selection of features that have already been
                 explored in various contexts, including subsorts,
                 partial functions, first-order logic, and structured
                 and architectural specifications. \textsc{Casl} should
                 facilitate interoperability of many existing algebraic
                 prototyping and verification tools. This paper gives an
                 overview of the \textsc{Casl} design. The major issues
                 that had to be resolved in the design process are
                 indicated, and all the main concepts and constructs of
                 \textsc{Casl} are briefly explained and illustrated the

The requirements on these networks and their usage, however, can differ significantly from traditional communication networks, with implications on all layers of the protocol stack. This article is motivated by these differences and, in particular, by the observation that many fundamental design aspects of these networks are not well-understood today. To support the networking community to contribute to this emerging application domain, we present a structured overview of the field, from topology and neighbor discovery, over block and transaction propagation, to sharding and off-chain networks, also reviewing existing empirical results from different measurement studies. In particular, for each of these domains, we provide the context, highlighting differences and commonalities with traditional networks, review the state-of-the-art, and identify open research challenges. Our article can hence also be seen as a call-to-arms to improve the foundation on top of which blockchains are built.},

We analyze how fundamental and circumstantial bottlenecks in Bitcoin limit the ability of its current peer-to-peer overlay network to support substantially higher throughputs and lower latencies. Our results suggest that reparameterization of block size and intervals should be viewed only as a first increment toward achieving next-generation, high-load blockchain protocols, and major advances will additionally require a basic rethinking of technical approaches. We offer a structured perspective on the design space for such approaches. Within this perspective, we enumerate and briefly discuss a number of recently proposed protocol ideas and offer several new ideas and open challenges.},
