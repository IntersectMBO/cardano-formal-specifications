cabal-version:      2.2
-- The cabal-version field refers to the version of the .cabal specification,
-- and can be different from the cabal-install (the tool) version and the
-- Cabal (the library) version you are using. As such, the Cabal (the library)
-- version used must be equal or greater than the version stated in this field.
-- Starting from the specification version 2.2, the cabal-version field must be
-- the first thing in the cabal file.

-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
synopsis: A performance model of Praos block diffusion

-- A longer description of the package.
description: 
    This package implements a performance model of the Praos block diffusion
    protocol. The model is based on the paper "Mind Your Outcomes", published in Computers,
    which can be found at: https://www.mdpi.com/2073-431X/11/3/45
    The model is implemented in Literate Haskell and uses the deltaq library for
    computing the diffusion time of blocks. The model is designed to be used
    for performance analysis and to understand the impact of different parameters.
